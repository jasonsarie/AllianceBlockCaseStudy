## Overview & Origin

AllianceBlock is a blockchain-agnostic protocol. A blockchain-agnostic protocol is a central platform that accepts different chains. (K.Clarke-Potter BlockHead, Jan 2 2019) AllianceBlock aims to be the industry standard for financial institutions and individuals to trade cryptocurrency legally. The protocol seeks to bridge decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi) by automating the transfer of digital tokens into bankable products. (Messari.io Profile of AllianceBlock) 

The company was incorporated on the 1st of January 2018. (crunchbase.com AllianceBlock Organization) 

The company founders are Amber Ghaddar, Matthijs de Vries and Rachid Ajaja. (crunchbase.com AllianceBlock Organization) 

Rachid Ajaja: Founder & Chief Executive Officer “a serial entrepreneur with an obsession for modelling, analytics development, quantitative analysis and data science …  was a Quantitative Analyst at Barclays … His impressive work received accolades from VINCI which commissioned him to help orchestrate the ambitious “smart highways and smart cities” project, combining AI and Blockchain.” (allianceblock.io Team and Partners) 

Matthijs de Vries: Founder & Chief Technology Officer “Matthijs has managed the product development of one of the largest Dutch companies: PostNL … lead the development of several unique AI products amongst which a ground-breaking chatbot.” (allianceblock.io Team and Partners) 

Amber Ghaddar: Founder & Chief Investment Officer “Before co-founding AllianceBlock, Amber was a fixed-income trader at JP Morgan in London … She spearheaded the Macro Systematic Strategies effort at JP Morgan, focusing on dynamic risk premia trading strategies.” (allianceblock.io Team and Partners) 

 The company began with the mission to provide an avenue for traditional finance to remain compliant with any jurisdiction as they bridge the gap into DeFi, allowing institutions to lawfully digitize their products as well as standardizing access to capital market investments. By joining both the decentralized financial ecosystem and the traditional financial ecosystem “AllianceBlock aims to become a globally compliant decentralized capital market”. (Messari.io Profile of AllianceBlock).  In July 2021 the company launched AllianceBridge, the bridge supports “Ethereum, Binace Smart Chain, Avalanche and Polygon and has plans in place to extend to both EVM-compatible and non-Evm networks.” (Messari.io Profile of AllianceBlock). EVM- Compatibility allows Etherum developers to migrate smart contracts to another chain which has EVM compatibility without having to write the code again. (support.token.im What is EVM compatible chain?). Another example of AllianceBlock optimizing interoperability as well as being blockchain-agnostic (Messari.io Profile of AllianceBlock).  

AllianceBlock was able to raise US$1 million from a seed round and US$500,000 through a private token sale on the 17th of August 2020. The company generated a total supply of 1 billion ALBT tokens, which was launched at their Token Generation Event, held two weeks after the private sale. (Messari.io Profile of AllianceBlock).

## Business Activities

DeFi has been growing at a rapid pace leading to massive innovations whilst traditional finance for the most part has been unable to bridge the gap due to compliance and regulations. Thus, this poses the question “How to connect Traditional Finance (TradFi) with the Decentralized and Digital Asset markets (DeFi) in order to allow a seamless and compliant flow of capital between both worlds.” (blog.allianceblock.io Feb 12, 2021 AllianceBlock: Building the future of Finance) AllianceBlock believes they have the solution to digitize real world assets such as real estate and commodities to be represented by a digital token. Users will be able to interact with DeFi and TradFi, trade assets as well as receiving data in a uniform manner that meets compliance, promoting the flow between the two markets. This will ensure safety and regulations to be introduced to a greater audience as trillions of dollars from TradFi make their way into the decentralized world of finance. (blog.allianceblock.io Feb 12, 2021 AllianceBlock: Building the future of Finance) Examples include; the Cross Border Regulatory Rule Engine which ensure compliance in the most effective way, the Onchain Investment Data API to house data from onchain and specialist providers to create innovative data analytics for Traditional Finance institutions as well as Trustless KYC/AML and Identity Verification allows users to identify themselves through trustless manner whilst letting them retain control of data. (blog.allianceblock.io Feb 12, 2021 AllianceBlock: Building the future of Finance) 

AllainceBlock has created this protocol to adhere to a range of customers in TradFi “AllianceBlock brings a host of benefits to private banks, investment banks, wealth managers, asset managers, stock exchanges, sovereign funds, mutual funds, pension funds, and credit unions.”. The Protocol also allows traders, KYC firms, lenders and intermediaries to share the same advantages. In the case of DeFi AllianceBlock will be able to integrate any platform with many of the modules in their arsenal whilst DeFi as a whole will be benefiting from the increased traffic which AllianceBlock can generate through its infustruste. (blog.allianceblock.io Feb 12, 2021 AllianceBlock: Building the future of Finance) 

A real world problem that Allianceblock is addressing is businesses spending billions on compliance. The opportunity cost spent away from core business goals make them less efficient. AllianceBlock aims to reduce the compliance burden on financial companies by, for example, reducing the various checks that must be done to identify a consumer such as Know-Your-Customer (KYC), and Due Diligence (DD) by making user complete the process once and having that approved process applicable across institutions. (blog.allianceblock.io Feb 12, 2021 AllianceBlock: Building the future of Finance)

The market size of each sector is vast, however the inclusion of platforms such as AllianceBlock can help the transition between DeFi and TradFi. Data indicates that “The global financial services market size is expected to grow from $23,319.52 billion in 2021 to $25,839.35 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8%.” (thebusinessresearchcompany.com March 2022 Financial Services Global Market Report 2022 (18)  In terms of DeFi “Most of these transactions originated from the DeFi services such as Uniswap, which facilitates over $1 billion swaps each day, as well as lending and borrowing protocols such as Aave, Compound and BondAppetit, with tens of billions in market size.” (A. Tolkachev, Cointelegraph, Nov 6 2021)

The solution that AllianceBlock offers which its competitors don't is the combination of the “DeFi layer, the Data Layer and the Regulatory and Compliance Layer”. (allianceblock.io, AllianceBlock) 
Defi Layer - AllianceBlock offers cross-chain interoperability with AllianceBlock Bridge. They also use AllianceBlock LMaaS (Liquidity Mining as a Service) and AllianceBlock DEX to access additional liquidity and volume. Another protocol within AllianceBlock is ‘AllianceBlock Funders’ giving users access to peer-to-peer funding.
Data Layer - this layer assists traditional finance and Defi projects monetize massive amounts of data which can be produced through AllianceBlock Data Tunnel
Regulatory and Compliance Layer - With the AllianceBlock TIDV (Trustless IDentity Verification) and the AllianceBlock Cross-Border Regulatory Compliance Rules Engine, the proposal is set to establish a scalable compliance framework for the DeFi industry. 







## Landscape

AllianceBlock is in DeFi which uses Blockchain “a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.” (ibm.com Blockchain overview) Blockchain services extend past financial transactions due to its secure and transparent nature and can cover areas such as logistics, energy, education and more. (S.Daley Blockchain Sep 01 2022) 

Within Blockchain there has been major trends and innovations over the last 5-10 years; (T.Kontzer 7 must-know blockchain trends Jun 04 2021)

Supply Chain transparency - data integrity and improved interoperability provides suppliers and consumers visibility into a product's life cycle.
Tokenization - being able to digitally represent assets in order to boost liquidity and push e-commerce to new heights. 
Decentralized identity management - giving users more convenience and control over their credentials through tokenizing a person's identity 
Blockchain-fueled AI - increasing efficiency of pattern matching and predictive analytics through unleashing machine learning algorithms.
Multi-organizational ERP - resource planning across organizations can improve through fusing ERP systems creating a “super ERP” 
Financial transformation - assets can be transferred more efficiently and new investment opportunities can arise.
 Cryptocurrency becoming mainstream - Governments are backing digital currencies or making their own whilst many major companies are adding currencies such as Bitcoin to their portfolio. 

Major Companies in the DeFI space (J.Ledbetter, Observer, The DeFi Dozen)
Terra Luna - founded in 2019 by Do Kown, Terra Luna has been referred to as a “DeFi one-two punch” as it is both a portocal and platform that pays itself by selling two tokens. The Algorithm creates new coins at the same rate of demand, stabilizing the value of the coin. Terra Luna’s competitive edge is being built on Cosmos SDK (an open source framework able to withhold multiple Proof-of-Stake blockchains (S.Daley Blockchain Sep 01 2022)) allowing for a higher degree of customization. 
MakerDAO - founded in 2015 by Rune Christensen “MakerDAO embodies one of the most complete visions for DeFi”. MakerDao gives users the opportunity to collateralize chosen cryptocurrency to reap loans in the form of a dollar-pegged stablecoin, which in this case is DAI. In 2020 “MakerDAO became the first DeFi protocol to hit the $1 billion mark in total value locked into its smart contracts. Today that figure is around $16 billion” which makes MakerDao a big player in the DeFi space. 
Avalanche - The goal of Avalanche is to “create a smart contract platform superior to Ethereum with a particular focus on DeFi” it aims to tackle one of Ethereum's main weaknesses with is loss of network speeds. The solution offered by the protocol “results in a speed of 4500 transactions per second per submit and a completion time of 3 seconds. This compares with 7 transactions per second on the Bitcoin network and 1 hr to complete.” this improvement of efficiency can spearhead the adoption of DeFi.  (docs.cosmos.network What is the Cosmos SDK) 

## Results 

Although AllianceBlock is still in its infancy in terms of the global impact it is aiming to have, they have made some notable partnerships, integrating AllianceBlock’s vast DeFi solutions. One popular partnership is Avalanche (discussed above). The integration allows access to the AllianceBlock DeFi Investment Terminal, NFT capabilities, solutions for identity verification, P2P financial services that meet compliance and trussless KYC whilst also enjoying derivative pricing engine and analytics that Avalanche already offer. (Medium AllianceBlock Bringing its Compliant DeFi Applications, Institutional Connections to Avalanche Ecosystem Apr 7 2021) 

The Core metrics used by protocols in DeFi to measure success are: (Treehouse.finance How to Make Sense of Metrics in DeFi? May 03, 2022) 


Total Value Locked - the TVL represents the overall sum of assets that are deposited into a DeFi protocol, such as tokens that are staked, tokens that are in liquidity pools and tokens that are borrowed. TVL is dependent on two factors which is the price and quantity of locked tokens. 
Market Capitalization - Often used to examine the size and popularity of a DeFi project, the market cap would refer to the total value of cryptocurrency at a specific point in time. Market cap is given by multiplying the token’s value with its circulation supply.
Active Wallet Addresses - used to gauge the number of unique active users.  
Trading Volume - refers to the total value of any one token that is being traded amongst users, over a certain period of time. The data is gathered by calculating all the recorded transactions on a network.  

AllianceBlock is reported to have $50 million in Total Locked Value. (limechain.tech AllianceBlock improves DeFi with a one-stop-shop liquidity mining platform) Information gathered from CoinMarketCap AllianceBlock currently has 10,567,030 in Market Cap and $45,360,934 in Fully Diluted Market Cap. The Total amount of Active Wallet Addresses as of 14/09/22 is 17,275 and the most recent daily Trading Volume was 334,825. (coinmarketcap.com AllianceBlock) 

Currently AllianceBlock is ranked #774 on CoinMarketCap (coinmarketcap.com AllianceBlock) although not in the forefront for most participants in DeFi, AllianceBlock is only in its infancy and is still developing. An encouraging aspect of AllianceBlock is the fantastic partnerships that they have acquired over the years such as ChainLink, Avalanche, Quant, Binance Smart Chain and polygon just to name a few.(allianceblock.io) These partnerships can give you an idea of the scope and scale of the companies that AllianceBlock are working with and how they can become a huge player in the DeFi space. 

## Recommendation

AllianceBlock is still in the early stages of their roadmap, however, If AllianceBlock are looking to become the industry standard they must implement a product or service that can help them increase their metrics and gain popularity within the DeFi community. The establishment of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) can assist AllianceBlock in achieving those goals. As it is a software that aligns with the industry AllianceBlock inhabits, as well as a mechanism to increase users and in particular staking within the project. 

A DAO is a software that runs on the blockchain, that allows users to have collective management over a project. Traditional organizations are managed by boards, committees and executives, DAO’s on the other hand are run by a set of rules written into the code and enforced by a network of computers. To gain access into a DAO and become a member you must first purchase the cryptocurrency. Once purchased users must stake their assets to be given voting privileges proportional to the amount they hold. Proposals are voted on and “subsequently instated based on the predetermined network consensus rules, and voters are rewarded with additional cryptocurrency for participating.” (kraken.com What is a DAO? (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)) 

The implementation of a DAO can benefit AllianceBlock in increasing metrics such as TVL, Active Wallets and Market Cap by enticing users to join AllianceBlock’s DAO due to the incentives it can offer. A DAO’s allure of voter privileges and the interest yielded from staking within an organization can advertise to users that are not yet invested into AllianceBlock to not only buy, but stake their token within the DAO. This influx of new users will increase the metrics that define DeFi projects which in turn can yield more popularity and strengthen communities. Another advantage of a DAO is that it creates a community as the implementation of a DAO will build more transparency allowing people to align for their collective interest. (tokenminds.co 4 Interesting Benefits of DAO Development) 

The main technologies that DAO’s utilize are;
Blockchain - “allows people to create rules and run programs across a network using open source code” 
Cryptocurrency - “provides the mechanism for rewarding those that contribute to the organization”
AI - “used to automatically execute smart contracts, analyze data to make decisions, and run the organization”
Interoperability - “they work to develop common blockchains that allow different DAO programs to communicate with one another, creating a web of interconnected DAOs.”
UI/UX - “improving the UI/UX and functionalities of DaaS software would greatly enable access to DAOs” (Zijian.K, Teo.F, Teo.E, and Fangyi.L tecnode global Jun 20 2022) 

These technologies are a correct fit for AllianceBlock as most are already being implemented by the system. Creating a DAO would be within reach for AllainceBlock whilst addressing some of the key issues facing AllianceBlock metrics and notoriety. By giving an opportunity for users to have voting power and yield interest from holding the currency, it can assist in the growth and establishment of the asipsiring industry standard AllianceBlock.
